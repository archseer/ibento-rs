difference between push and pull -> pull for historic data
grpc since the data is unstructured
use google cloud style subscriptions that are persisted on the server end
also that allows us to do seek style apis
do we care about ack?

bidi stream where we can request more data

implementing the subscribe historic + more could be a catchup type subscription
like in eventstore that's implemented on the user end with a buffer

how do we deal with continuous poll with backpressure if there's no results?
I guess resched

topic: type:id or type:$all or $all?
